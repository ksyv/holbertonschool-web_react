## Requirements
### General

* Allowed editors:vi,vim,emacs,Visual Studio Code
* All of your files should end with a new line
* AREADME.mdfile at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

## Task
### 0. Basic setup <a name='subparagraph0'></a>

Create and run Webpack using a basic installation.

* Create a folder named <code>task_0</code>.
* Install <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code>  as developer dependencies within the folder using <code>npm</code>.
* Install <code>jQuery</code> as a regular dependency using <code>npm</code>.
* Make sure that <code>webpack</code> and <code>webpack-cli</code> are listed under the devDependencies key along with <code>jQuery</code> being listed under the dependencies key within the package.json
* Create a <code>src</code> directory with a <code>index.js</code> in it.
* The file should import <code>jquery</code> and add three different paragraphs to the page body: (refer to this <a href="/rltoken/XJSRYhglsAljFvprI-PcDQ" target="_blank" title="link">link</a> under the Babel section for importing jQuery)

```
Holberton Dashboard

Dashboard data for the students

Copyright - Holberton School
```

* Create a <code>dist/index.html</code>. Import your <code>main.js</code> in the body.
* You must use <code>jQuery</code> to add the elements to the body of the page.
* When running <code>Webpack</code>, your <code>javascript</code> and <code>html</code> files should be generated in a <code>dist</code> folder.
* You should not use a custom <code>webpack</code> config file.
* Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
* Your <code>html</code> code should only import one <code>Javascript</code> script (the one generated by <code>webpack</code>).
* Do NOT push your <code>dist/main.js</code> if you have one.

### 1. Learning how to use Webpack with a config file <a name='subparagraph1'></a>

<strong>Installing packages</strong>

* Create a folder named <code>task_1</code>, <code>cd</code> into it, and create a package.json using <code>npm init -y</code>
* Install webpack (dev dependency), jQuery (dependency), and Lodash (dependency) within the folder using <code>npm</code>.
* Modify your <code>package.json</code> to add a <code>build</code> script that runs <code>webpack</code> to create build output. This lets you execute <code>npm run build</code> on the command line.

<strong>Using jQuery</strong>

* Create a <code>js</code> directory with a javascript file named <code>dashboard_main.js</code> in it. The file should import <code>jquery</code> and add the below elements in the following order:


  * Paragraph element: <code>Holberton Dashboard</code>
  * Paragraph element: <code>Dashboard data for the students</code>
  * Button element with the text <code>Click here to get started</code>
  * Add a paragraph element as so <code>&lt;p id='count'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>
  * Add another paragraph: <code>Copyright - Holberton School</code>

<strong>Prevent spammers</strong>

* Write a function called <code>updateCounter()</code> that tracks the number of times the button element has been clicked.
* Each time it’s called, update the count by 1 and set the content of the paragraph element with id=‘count’ to <code>{count} clicks on the button</code>
* Bind the debounce function in Lodash to the click event on the button you created previously (The number of milliseconds to delay invocation should be 500).

<strong>Requirements:</strong>

* When running Webpack, your javascript should be generated in a <code>public</code> folder. You should also place your index.html in this folder.
* The javascript file generated by Webpack should be named <code>bundle.js</code>
* Set Webpack config mode to production
* Opening your html file should not generate any error in the console
* Your html code should only import one Javascript script (the one generated by webpack)

### 2. Adding CSS & Images <a name='subparagraph2'></a>

<strong>Install these</strong> <code>devDependencies</code>:

* css-loader
* file-loader
* image-webpack-loader
* style-loader

Create a specific configuration for Webpack.

* Using the folder named <code>task_2</code>.
* Reuse the code from <code>task_1</code>.
* Modify the webpack config to support adding CSS to the bundle.
* Modify the webpack config to support adding images to the CSS.
* Create a folder named <code>css</code>
* In a file named <code>main.css</code>, change the position of the counter text to be displayed on the right of the button and in bold.
* Add an element at the top of document with the id <code>#logo</code> which has a width of 200px and height of 200px.
* Set the background of th element with the image in <code>task_2/assets/holberton-logo.jpg</code>.
* Set the width and height of the logo background image to 200px by 200px.
* Make sure to configure Webpack to optimize images.
* When running Webpack, your javascript and html files should be generated in a <code>public</code> folder.
* The javascript file generated by Webpack should be named <code>bundle.js</code>.
* Set Webpack config mode to production.
* Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
* Your html code should only import one Javascript script (the one generated by webpack).
* When running Webpack, you should not see the warning <code>WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit</code>

---

### 3. Dev servers, modules, and tree shaking <a name='subparagraph3'></a>

<strong>Install these</strong> <code>devDependencies</code>:

* clean-webpack-plugin
* html-webpack-plugin
* webpack-dev-server

Using the folder named <code>task_3</code>. <strong>Set up a development server:</strong>

* Reuse the code from <code>task_2</code>.
* Modify the Webpack config to setup a development server running on the port 8564.
* Modify the Webpack config to set its <code>mode</code> to <code>development</code>.
* Add a script in the <code>package.json</code> to start the server and open the browser with <code>npm run start-dev</code>.

<strong>Divide the code into modules:</strong>

* Divide the main bundle into three modules.
* <code>header</code> should contain a <code>header.css</code> and <code>header.js</code> files.
* Import jQuery, and add the logo and the H1 title to the <code>header.js</code> file (with content <code>Holberton Dashboard</code>). Add a console.log printing <code>Init header</code>.
* Add the needed style to the <code>header.css</code> file.
* <code>body</code> should contain a <code>body.css</code> and <code>body.js</code> files.
* Import jQuery, Lodash and add the body code (button, counter) in the <code>body.js</code> file.
* Add the needed style to the <code>body.css</code> file.
* <code>footer</code> should contain a <code>footer.css</code> and <code>footer.js</code> files.
* Import jQuery, and append a paragraph the copyright text <code>Copyright - Holberton School</code>.
* Add the needed style to the <code>footer.css</code> file.
* Modify the Webpack configuration to support three different entry points (<code>header</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>footer</code>). Each entry point should generate a filename with the following format <code>name_of_the_file.bundle.js</code>.
* Do NOT have a <code>task_3/public/</code> directory pushed to your repository.
* Add a plugin to Webpack to automatically create an <code>index.html</code> HTML file

<strong>Improve development speed</strong>

* Modify the webpack config to support inline source mapping.
* Check that the console.log in the header.js now takes you to your javascript file instead of the main bundle.
* Add a plugin to Webpack to clean your build folder on each build.

<strong>Improve bundles size:</strong>

* You can see that the current modules generated with <code>npm run build</code> are quite large. They all contain jQuery and/or Lodash. Modify the Webpack configuration to split the modules in chunks.

<strong>Requirements:</strong>

* When running the dev server, your code should work on <code>http://localhost:8564/</code>.
* When running Webpack, your javascript and html files should be generated in a <code>public</code> folder.
* Opening your main file should not generate any error in the console.
